* Completion style

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
=orderless= provides a completion style that divides the pattern into
space-separated components, and matches candidates that match all of the
components in any order. Each component can match in any one of several ways:
literally, as a regexp, as an initialism, in the flex style, or as multiple word
prefixes. By default, regexp and literal matches are enabled. [[[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][source]]]
