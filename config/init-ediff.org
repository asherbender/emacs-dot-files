  ;; The multiframe setup is done by the ediff-setup-windows-multiframe function,
  ;; which is the default on windowing displays. The plain setup, one where all
  ;; windows are always in one frame, is done by ediff-setup-windows-plain, which
  ;; is the default on a non-windowing display (or in an xterm window). In fact,
  ;; under Emacs, you can switch freely between these two setups by executing the
  ;; command ediff-toggle-multiframe using the Minibuffer of the Menubar.

  ;; Controls the way you want the window be split between file-A and file-B (and
  ;; file-C, if applicable). It defaults to the vertical split
  ;; (split-window-vertically, but you can set it to split-window-horizontally, if
  ;; you so wish. Ediff also lets you switch from vertical to horizontal split and
  ;; back interactively.
