* General settings

** Configuration variables

Define column and tab widths.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defconst default-column-width   80)
(defconst default-code-tab-width 4 )
#+END_SRC

Create group for auto-generated files.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defgroup user-emacs-auto nil
  "Group for configuring Emacs auto-generated files."
  :group 'extensions)

(defcustom user-emacs-auto-directory
  (concat user-emacs-directory "auto/")
  "Directory beneath which additional per-user Emacs-specific, auto-generated
  files are placed. This variable can be used to configure Emacs to store
  automatically generated information in this directory. Note that this should
  end with a directory separator."
  :group 'user-emacs-auto
  :type 'directory)

;; Make auto-generated files directory if it does not exist.
(unless (file-directory-p user-emacs-auto-directory)
  (make-directory user-emacs-auto-directory t))

#+END_SRC

Move the location used for storing customisation information to a separate
file. This will stop Emacs from appending data to [[https://github.com/asherbender/emacs-dot-files/blob/master/init.el][init.el]].
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(customize-set-variable 'custom-file (concat user-emacs-directory "custom.el"))
#+END_SRC

** Auto-reverts

Automatically revert any buffer associated with a file when the file changes on
disk.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-auto-revert-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

Automatically revert the Buffer List associated with a directory when the
directory contents changes on disk. This is useful for keeping `buffer-menu` and
Dired synchronised with changes on the disk.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers 1)
#+END_SRC

** User interface

This variable, if non-nil, inhibits the startup screen. If non-nil, Emacs
typically displays the ~*scratch*~ buffer (see the variable
initial-buffer-choice).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq inhibit-startup-screen t)
#+END_SRC

Do not show tool-bar or scroll-bar on window systems.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(when window-system
  (tooltip-mode     1)
  (tool-bar-mode   -1)
  (menu-bar-mode    1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
)
#+END_SRC

Alias yes-or-no questions to y-or-n
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
#+END_SRC

Use Global Font Lock mode to automagically turn on Font Lock mode
(contex highlighting) in buffers whose major mode supports it and
whose major mode is one of `font-lock-global-modes'.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-font-lock-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

This makes the buffer scroll by only a single line when the up or down
cursor keys push the cursor outside the buffer. The standard emacs
behaviour is to reposition the cursor in the center of the screen, but
this can make the scrolling confusing.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq scroll-step 1)
#+END_SRC

Toggle visualization of matching parens. When enabled, any
matching parenthesis is highlighted in `show-paren-style' after
`show-paren-delay' seconds of Emacs idle time.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(show-paren-mode t)
(setq show-paren-delay 0)
#+END_SRC

** Cursor line

Highlight the line containing the cursor in every buffer.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-hl-line-mode 1)
(set-face-foreground 'hl-line "black")
(set-face-background 'hl-line "yellow")
#+END_SRC

** Selection behaviour

When Transient Mark mode is enabled, the region is highlighted
whenever the mark is active. The mark is "deactivated" by changing the
buffer, and after certain other operations that set the mark but whose
main purpose is something else--for example, incremental search, <,
and >. (In GNU Emacs 23 and onwards, it is enabled by default)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(transient-mark-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

When Delete Selection mode is enabled, typed text replaces the
selection if the selection is active. Otherwise, typed text is just
inserted at point regardless of any selection.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(delete-selection-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** Scrolling

Scroll the buffer with several lines of padding around the cursor.
This keep lines of context around the cursor visible during
scrolling.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

;; Scroll text pixel-by-pixel.
(setq pixel-scroll-mode t)

;; Number of lines of margin at the top and bottom of a window.  Trigger
;; automatic scrolling whenever point gets within this many lines of the top or
;; bottom of the window.
(setq scroll-margin 5)

;; Built into Emacs 29.
(if (>= emacs-major-version 29)
  (progn
    ;; Allow pixel scrolling according to the turning of the mouse wheel.
    (setq pixel-scroll-precision-mode t)
  )
)
#+END_SRC

Fully expand org file structures when loading.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-startup-folded nil)
#+END_SRC
